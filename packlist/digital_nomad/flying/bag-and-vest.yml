    December 2024 update; we now use a "breathable fishing vest"
    This vest has a mesh net frame with pockets on top of it,
    my specific model even has a zipped mesh back pocket that fits a laptop in it.
    Alternatives are [this](https://www.rova.nz/articles/this-puffer-jacket-zips-into-a-tote-so-lemme-secure-that-bag) special jacket for women,
    or this unisex one:
    [TS Convertible travel jacket bag](https://tsimpact.com/products/dual-layer-jacket-convertible-to-carry-on-shoulder-bag-backpack-travel-active-unisex).

    After using the MH100 for about 40 flights/8 months,
    I noticed I was not using my laptop on the road because
    it's just too hard to reach.
    That's why I switched to the
    Forclaz Travel 500 ORGANIZER.
    This backpack does not have a stiff frame,
    but I have my laptop in it always anyways.
    This Forclaz has a separate zipper for the laptop pouch.
    After the first time use, I found that when full, I need to have the shoulder
    straps on the maximum length if using the hip band,
    thus if you are taller than 185cm, skip this backpack.

    In case the ground steward is checking bag sizes, we;
    wear one vest, a second as a skirt and our jacket.
    The jacket we fill on one side with our toiletry bag and on the other with pill container.
    We wear our
    [Zipplicity Neck Pack/tubular travel pillow](https://eur.shein.com/pdsearch/travel%20neck%20pillow%20filling).
