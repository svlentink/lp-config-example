    The Quechua MH100 35L was picked over the MH500 40L,
    because the stiff frame that makes the backpack breathable is
    a single metal rod on the 35L and a square frame on the 40L.
    The rod is easier to remove and wear under clothes
    in case an airliner would check if the backpack fits in the
    maximum allowed bag tester.

    In case the ground steward is checking bag sizes, we;
    wear one vest, a second as a skirt and our jacket.
    The jacket we fill on one side with our toiletry bag and on the other with pill container.
    We wear our
    [Zipplicity Neck Pack/tubular travel pillow](https://eur.shein.com/pdsearch/travel%20neck%20pillow%20filling).
