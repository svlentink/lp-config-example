    After using the MH100 for about 40 flights/8 months,
    I noticed I was not using my laptop on the road because
    it's just too hard to reach.
    That's why I switched to the
    Forclaz Travel 500 ORGANIZER.
    This backpack does not have a stiff frame,
    but I have my laptop in it always anyways.
    This Forclaz has a separate zipper for the laptop pouch.
    After the first time use, I found that when full, I need to have the shoulder
    straps on the maximum length if using the hip band,
    thus if you are taller than 185cm, skip this backpack.

    In case the ground steward is checking bag sizes, we;
    wear one vest, a second as a skirt and our jacket.
    The jacket we fill on one side with our toiletry bag and on the other with pill container.
    We wear our
    [Zipplicity Neck Pack/tubular travel pillow](https://eur.shein.com/pdsearch/travel%20neck%20pillow%20filling).
