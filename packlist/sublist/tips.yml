tips:
- put everything on the (sub)lists in the order that you will pack them (usually large items first or least important/bottom of bag)
- everything that can leak, put it in a separate plastic bag
- buy things duplicate, so you can have a set of stuff ready at all times (comb, socks etc.)
- traveling long and often? consider bringing a wetstone, smoke alarm and plunger along
- Practice living out of your suitcase for a week before you leave; missed anything?
- use mesh wash bags or see-through bags for organizing stuff
#- always put some clothing in your carry-on luggage for when hold luggage gets lost
#- During packing, use two laundry bins, one for what to wear/pack on me, one for the backpack.
