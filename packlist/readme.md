[say to pack for a week](https://hobowithalaptop.com/digital-nomad-packing-list) as a digital nomad,
however, this would make me forget my beard, smartwatch and toothbrush charger as well as nail clippers.

The data structure allows for nested lists and dictionaries,
however, if you want to be safe, just use lists!
