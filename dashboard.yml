        For historical purposes, I've created an overview of my life of when I was a part time student
        and of my pre lockdown life (work with commuting).
        Nowadays my life switches between 3 modes; work from home (WFH) in NL (cold climate in winter),
        WFH in a warmer climate (thus doing sports outdoors)
        and being a digital nomad.
        All 5 lives are arranged differently.

            I want my colleagues to see me as the one that gets it done and delivers the work (Matt 5:41),
            in a way that they feel it's safe to give it out of their hands, don't need to worry about it.
            People remember how you made them feel, not what you delivered.
            I want to see myself as an athlete, which motivates me to eat healthy and take care of my body.
            I want my children to see me as someone that manages stress well by going out in nature and playing an instrument to relax.

            During the lockdown in 2020 I went flying as digital nomad.
            This became harder in 2021 and some major border crossing were closed,
            but small bike / pedestrian crossings remained open.
            This enabled me to use these roads to travel with my motorcycles through
            various countries in the EU (as a digital nomad).

        What you measure you will monitor.

        Tnen we acknowledge our short comings/inefficiencies.
        From which we can begin to improve.
        
        A colleague asked why I did not include my deep sleep in the graph.
        Basically I try to measure what I want to impact directly.
        Since I already know that not drinking alcohol and doing physical exercise helps,
        I just try to focus on that.
        For goals I'm working towards, like the bar-muscle-up I put a decimal value
        for all the day that I was working on it but still wasn't able to achieve it.
