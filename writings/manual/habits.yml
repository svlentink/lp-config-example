    The goals we have should be worked on by activities we incorporate in our routines.
    Working on them is most easy when it becomes a habit
    (which is a
    [cue + routine + reward](https://zapier.com/blog/daily-routines/)).
    When we want stronger abs (reward),
    we can create a habit of sitting on a fitness ball.
    The science on willpower
    ([ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion))
    learns us that it takes more willpower
    to go to the gym than actually doing the excersizes there.
    Having this knowledge, we set a low-bar on our activities when forming a new habit.
    When you aim for doing pushups or reading in the morning,
    it is good to allow for just one pushup/sentence (low-bar),
    which creates the pattern of getting into the position/grabbing a book.
    For this reason it is good to have a resting day (just like major religions have),
    getting you familiar with picking up the routine when you have skipped a day.

    In the data, we define activities, which we give a priority (MoSCoW)
    and specify if it
