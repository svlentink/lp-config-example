    The
    [Eisenhower matrix](https://www.developgoodhabits.com/eisenhower-matrix)
    provides us with an easy way of visualizing our personal backlog.
    The
    [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/)
    urges us to distinct the items into what we
    *want*, *should* or *need* to do.
  
    It is not part of the print layout since it should be revised daily.
  
    For work/study/projects one should have a different system,
    such as a *Product Backlog* used in Scrum or Kanban.
    <br/>
    For coding projects one could have the backlog items
    (as markdown files/open issues)
    inside the Git project, containing developer notes
    and use a link to it on the Project Planning board.
    This allows you to keep everything of the project;
    requested features, documentation, diagrams etc.
    inside the Git project, except for the (centralized) planning.
