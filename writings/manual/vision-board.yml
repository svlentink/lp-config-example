    This vision board is aimed at helping you with autobiographical planning.
    It visualizes the multiple personas/identities/roles you have (on the blue sky).
    For each persona you are able to set goals.

    As a foundation (the earth beneath) we have our strenghts, values and weaknesses.

    #### Goals
    Goals should be positive. When we say 'I cannot eat suger' (negative),
    we still identify ourself with someone who eats sugar.
    If you say
    'I am an athlete, therefore I do not eat sugar' (positive),
    it's easier to abstain from sugar.
    
    For goals we define four stages/status;
    - idea
    - progressing &#8635;
    - maintaining &#128736;
    - done
    
    Of which we visualize progressing &#8635; and maintaining &#128736; and hide idea and done from the overview.
    
    Something can start as a difficult goal and develop into a
    [passion](https://youtu.be/6MBaFL7sCb8),
    just like your first piano class was hard.
    <br/>
    Before creating this vision board,
    we advice some basic understanding of
    [Maslow's hierachy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) <!--
    Aristotle about happiness, first meet physical needs
    -->,
    [Sapolsky's research on dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axrywDP9Ii0),
    growth mindset,
    [Nietzsche, The Gay Science, §290](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/intro/gs290.html)
    and
    [Human, All Too Human](https://academyofideas.com/2017/07/psychology-of-self-deception/)

    We define roles/personas because this helps us associate ourself with the behavior needed to accomplish this (sankalpa).

    ## Why YAML

    YAML is the easiest configuration language out there, easier than JSON/XML/HCL (and support anchors).
    We use a configuration language instead of a GUI because we want the user to feel like an admin of one's life.
    GUIs abstract you from what is underneath and requires less grind,
    this tool is for dedicated users, who are committed to making a change, a change in their own lives.
    If you need a GUI, you're not the target audience, you're not willing to put in the work needed.

    ### Self hosted
    This YAML and CSV based approach allows one to totally self-host their own data sources.
    Google sheets allows you to have sheets as CSV, with Google forms in front of it allows you to track your own data.
