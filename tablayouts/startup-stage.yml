        How would you feel when using this product?
        You will feel in control. Where therapist take control and steer you, with this tool you are in control.

        This tool will help you run your life like a startup.
        Stage1, pitch:
        Startups usually give pitches, to potential employees and investors.
        To pitch the potential of your life, you have to present your vision.
        Stage2, plan:
        Then when building onto that vision, show which actions (habits) you undertake to get there.
        Stage3, measure:
        And finally, show through metrics the growth.
        Stage4, exit:
        When you want to sell a business, you need to show your company's books are in order and have it organized.
        We all gonna die, but having your life organized in such a way that everyone can take over in case you
        end up behind bars or die, requires a level of organization that few have.
        Why go this far? Because it helps you automate or outsource parts of your life.
        Having a cleaner and personal assistant requires you to first be the person that could hand over stuff.
        Becoming the person that can do this will make you more sophisticated, more organized and more structured.

        Why a startup?
        Let's look at it differently.
        Who are the most productive examples of self improvement and what do they do?
        They usually also run a business.
        What businesses are the fastest at development,
        most agile and lean? Startups.

        Tools that are used for running a business can also be used for running your private life.
        From a birthday calendar to a spreadsheet to track your fitness progress,
        both tools originally created for business.
        Your life is not like a big corporate, but a bit like a startup, nimble and agile.

        There are lots of solutions for investing your money,
        this tool is a way to assist you in investing your time in what matters to you.

        We will work by first capturing the current state,
        then slowly changing things over time (no one is able to stick with too much changes a the same time).
        We then add analytics (tracking metrics) to keep you motivated (don't break the streak).

            Gradually we start to introduce more tooling into your life.
            It's not a radical switch but a gradual integration into your life.

            You determine your own pace,
            but don't go too fast, you should make things a habit,
            it's not a homework assignment to be filled out.

            We call this slacking off (productive procrastination).
            When we need a break off of work,
            walking to get a glass of water or doing pushups is a good non addictive way to break work,
            scrolling social media isn't.

            interstitialtime activities; portable, amid distractions, chunckable into small increments

            Secondly, keep a list of topics you need to ponder over.
            Look at this list before activities that relax the mind,
            like running in nature.

            Last week we got the baseline and got into the habit of living with a calendar.
            This week we keep up the good work but start adding goals to it.

            Being correct in your planning is not the goal,
            being correct and consistent in applying the tools and living more by calendar is.

            Don't make too much resolutions to yourself, rather plan in such a way that you can keep your promises to yourself.

        1.1 organize:
        - type: title
          data: Organize your life
        - type: desc
          data: |
            Incremental increase is the focus.
            Don't try to change everything at once,
            sticking to your schedule is the most important.
            Be realistic, rather be less ambitious and succeed than overly ambitious and fail.

            Put your running shoes to the front, sport cloths at the top of your folded cloths.

            On your phone's homescreen;
            - Calendar widget (positive; helps you stick to calendar)
            - note taking app (positive; organize your thoughts)
            - DuoLingo (positive way to distract yourself)
            - AntennaPod (neutral; allows distraction while doing chores)
            - Translate (neutral; no risk of infinite scrolling)
            - Maps (neutral)

            Review your schedule, reflect on it and iterate,
            become more accurate/punctual.
            An alternative is to be more flexible and less rigid,
            making your schedule more forgiven/attainable.

            How can I find more time for this?



            What brought me the most happiness?

            How can I help these activities to happen more often?



            Who are the people that had the greatest impact on me?

            How can I see and collaborate with them more?



            What did I expect to complete, but didn’t?

            Is this still an important goal of mine? If so, how can I make future follow-through more likely?



            What are the least valuable ways I am spending my time?

            How can I prevent myself from continuing to spend time in this way?



            How have my goals or priorities shifted over the last few months?

            Is there anything I am still doing that is no longer in alignment? Why?

            PLAN
            What would I do this year if I wanted to make 85 year old me miserable?



            What would 85 year old me wish I did more of?



            What are the things I do to make my day go great?



            What things make my days go terribly?



            What do I think is productive that isn’t?



            What is productive that I don’t realise?



            What do I want to do less of with my time?



            What do I want to do more of with my time?



            What does an ideal normal day look like? Write it out.



            What conversations do I need to have?



            What are the habits I’m committing to starting and stopping?




            FINAL THOUGHTS
            What would have had to have happened by the end of next year for me to look back on the year and consider it a success?



            Who do I need to become for next year’s chapter of my life story to turn out the way I would write it?



            Knowing what I know now, what advice would I give to myself 12 months ago? (pssst - you probably still need to hear this now)

            What you measure you will monitor.
            What you monitor you are aware of.
            Awareness is the first step.
            Tnen we acknowledge our short comings/inefficiencies.
            From which we can begin to improve.
            
            A colleague asked why I did not include my deep sleep in the graph.
            Basically I try to measure what I want to impact directly.
            Since I already know that not drinking alcohol and doing physical exercise helps,
            I just try to focus on that.
            For goals I'm working towards, like the bar-muscle-up I put a decimal value
            for all the day that I was working on it but still wasn't able to achieve it.

        3.1 Daily metrics:
        - $REPO_DIR/metrics/main.yml

        3.2 Weekly metrics:
        - $REPO_DIR/metrics/main.yml

        3.3 Quarterly review:
        - type: desc
          data: |
            We now know our roles, goals and how we allocate our time.
            Let's do our first quarterly review.
            Where we only tracked metrics for our daily and weekly review,
            for our quarterly review we write down more text.
            We set resolutions per quarter instead of per year.
            Assuming you are a fit adult between 20 and 70,
            annual review and resolutions would only give us 50 start.
            Doing it per quarter let's us realign 200 times,
            increasing the likelyhood of success.

        3.4 Occasional metrics:
        - type: desc
          data: |
            Some things are measured occasionally but still could be valuable to have access to.

        3.5 Correlate:
        - type: desc
          data: |
            We now have goals (KPI/OKR) and metrics.
            Let's now be an analyst and see how we can correlate the two.
            Using this found correlation, we can now schedule/plan
            more efficient.

            Are you really on track?
            Did you create a system that works or that just works for you at this moment?
            Let's follow the Feynman technique by teaching it to someone else.
            By forcing yourself to explain it to someone else,
            you deeping your own understanding and confiction.
            Just like
            [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program#Sponsorship)
            systems use buddy/coaching systems as well.

            We also use this space to define activities which we allow ourself when in need of some slacking.
            These slacking activities should idealy be short and finite.

            
            Don't present yourself as someone who figured it out,
            but someone who is growing through actively trying to be the analyst steering their own life.

            You get to gift anyone a month for free by being their teacher (both have write access).
            Also serves as a commitment device, since you pretend to be a teacher, you need to sound convincing.

        In order to outsource work, we need to have things
        have processees and documentation in place in order for it to safely hand it over.

        The goals is to have things outsoureable.

            During the lockdown in 2020 I went flying as digital nomad.
            This became harder in 2021 and some major border crossing were closed,
            but small bike / pedestrian crossings remained open.
            This enabled me to use these roads to travel with my motorcycles through
            various countries in the EU (as a digital nomad).

        Becoming a minimalist is about caring less about stuff and more about experiences.
        Stuff degrate/depreciate and need to be maintained, it locks you down.
        However... living like a true digital nomad is a only achievable for remote working singles.

        Personally it took me more than a year to slowly/comfortably downsize (around 30y old).
        Then after moving countries and getting real estate that needed renovation,
        I again acquired a lot of stuff (tools/materials).
