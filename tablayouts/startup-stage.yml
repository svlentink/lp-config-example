        This tool will help you run your life like a startup.
        Stage1, pitch:
        Startups usually give pitches, to potential employees and investors.
        To pitch the potential of your life, you have to present your vision.
        Stage2, plan:
        Then when building onto that vision, show which actions (habits) you undertake to get there.
        Stage3, measure:
        And finally, show through metrics the growth.
        Stage4, exit:
        When you want to sell a business, you need to show your company's books are in order and have it organized.
        We all gonna die, but having your life organized in such a way that everyone can take over in case you
        end up behind bars or die, requires a level of organization that few have.
        Why go this far? Because it helps you automate or outsource parts of your life.
        Having a cleaner and personal assistant requires you to first be the person that could hand over stuff.
        Becoming the person that can do this will make you more sophisticated, more organized and more structured.

        Why a startup? Tools that are used for running a business can also be used for running your private life.
        From a calendar to a spreadsheet to track your fitness progress, tools originally created for business.
        Your life is not like a big corporate, but a bit like a startup, nimble and agile.

        We will work by first capturing the current state,
        then slowly changing things over time (no one is able to stick with too much changes a the same time).
        We add analytics (tracking metrics) as a motivation (don't break the streak).

            Gradually we start to introduce more tooling into your life.
            It's not a radical switch but a gradual integration into your life.

            You determine your own pace,
            but don't go too fast, you should make things a habit,
            it's not a homework assignment to be filled out.

            When we need a break off of work,
            walking to get a glass of water or doing pushups is a good non addictive way to break work,
            scrolling social media isn't.

            Secondly, keep a list of topics you need to ponder over.

            Last week we got the baseline and got into the habit of living with a calendar.
            This week we keep up the good work but start adding goals to it.

            Being correct in your planning is not the goal,
            being correct and consistent in applying the tools and living more by calendar is.

            Don't make too much resolutions to yourself, rather plan in such a way that you can keep your promises to yourself.

        1.1 organize:
        - type: title
          data: Organize your life
        - type: desc
          data: |
            Incremental increase is the focus.
            Don't try to change everything at once,
            sticking to your schedule is the most important.
            Be realistic, rather be less ambitious and succeed than overly ambitious and fail.
        - type: calendar
          data: &seedcal
            routines: $STARTUP_DIR/stage0/routines.yml

            Planning your life should become an habit.

        - type: desc
          data: |
            Hide away your sweets, display fruit.
            Hide your TV, put your instrument in a prominent place.
            Put your running shoes to the front, sport cloths at the top of your folded cloths.

            On your phone's homescreen;
            - Calendar widget (positive; helps you stick to calendar)
            - note taking app (positive; organize your thoughts)
            - DuoLingo (positive way to distract yourself)
            - AntennaPod (neutral; allows distraction while doing chores)
            - Translate (neutral; no risk of infinite scrolling)
            - Maps (neutral)

        - type: title
          data: Review schedule
        - type: desc
          data: |
            Review your schedule, reflect on it and iterate,
            become more accurate/punctual.
            An alternative is to be more flexible and less rigid,
            making your schedule more forgiven/attainable.

            What you measure you will monitor.
            What you monitor you are aware of.
            Awareness is the first step.
            Tnen we acknowledge our short comings/inefficiencies.
            From which we can begin to improve.
            
            A colleague asked why I did not include my deep sleep in the graph.
            Basically I try to measure what I want to impact directly.
            Since I already know that not drinking alcohol and doing physical exercise helps,
            I just try to focus on that.
            For goals I'm working towards, like the bar-muscle-up I put a decimal value
            for all the day that I was working on it but still wasn't able to achieve it.

        3.1 Daily metrics:
        - $REPO_DIR/metrics/main.yml

        3.2 Weekly metrics:
        - $REPO_DIR/metrics/main.yml

        3.3 Quarterly review:
        - type: desc
          data: |
            We now know our roles, goals and how we allocate our time.
            Let's do our first quarterly review.
            Where we only tracked metrics for our daily and weekly review,
            for our quarterly review we write down more text.
            We set resolutions per quarter instead of per year.
            Assuming you are a fit adult between 20 and 70,
            annual review and resolutions would only give us 50 start.
            Doing it per quarter let's us realign 200 times,
            increasing the likelyhood of success.

        3.4 Occasional metrics:
        - type: desc
          data: |
            Some things are measured occasionally but still could be valuable to have access to.

        3.5 Correlate:
        - type: desc
          data: |
            We now have goals (KPI/OKR) and metrics.
            Let's now be an analyst and see how we can correlate the two.
            Using this found correlation, we can now schedule/plan
            more efficient.

            Are you really on track?
            Did you create a system that works or that just works for you at this moment?
            Let's follow the Feynman technique by teaching it to someone else.
            By forcing yourself to explain it to someone else,
            you deeping your own understanding and confiction.
            Just like
            [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program#Sponsorship)
            systems use buddy/coaching systems as well.

            We also use this space to define activities which we allow ourself when in need of some slacking.
            These slacking activities should idealy be short and finite.

            
            Don't present yourself as someone who figured it out,
            but someone who is growing through actively trying to be the analyst steering their own life.

            You get to gift anyone a month for free by being their teacher (both have write access).
            Also serves as a commitment device, since you pretend to be a teacher, you need to sound convincing.

            During the lockdown in 2020 I went flying as digital nomad.
            This became harder in 2021 and some major border crossing were closed,
            but small bike / pedestrian crossings remained open.
            This enabled me to use these roads to travel with my motorcycles through
            various countries in the EU (as a digital nomad).

        Becoming a minimalist is about caring less about stuff and more about experiences.
        Stuff degrate/depreciate and need to be maintained, it locks you down.
        However... living like a true digital nomad is a only achievable for remote working singles.

        Personally it took me more than a year to slowly/comfortably downsize (around 30y old).
        Then after moving countries and getting real estate that needed renovation,
        I again acquired a lot of stuff (tools/materials).
