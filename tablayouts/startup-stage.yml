        This tool will help you run your life like a startup.
        Stage1, pitch:
        Startups usually give pitches, to potential employees and investors.
        To pitch the potential of your life, you have to present your vision.
        Stage2, plan:
        Then when building onto that vision, show which actions (habits) you undertake to get there.
        Stage3, measure:
        And finally, show through metrics the growth.
        Stage4, exit:
        When you want to sell a business, you need to show your company's books are in order and have it organized.
        We all gonna die, but having your life organized in such a way that everyone can take over in case you
        end up behind bars or die, requires a level of organization that few have.
        Why go this far? Because it helps you automate or outsource parts of your life.
        Having a cleaner and personal assistant requires you to first be the person that could hand over stuff.
        Becoming the person that can do this will make you more sophisticated, more organized and more structured.

        Why a startup? Tools that are used for running a business can also be used for running your private life.
        From a calendar to a spreadsheet to track your fitness progress, tools originally created for business.
        Your life is not like a big corporate, but a bit like a startup, nimble and agile.

        We will work by first capturing the current state,
        then slowly changing things over time (no one is able to stick with too much changes a the same time).
        We add analytics (tracking metrics) as a motivation (don't break the streak).

        Gradually we start to introduce more tooling into your life.
        It's not a radical switch but a gradual integration into your life.

        You determine your own pace,
        but don't go too fast, you should make things a habit,
        it's not a homework assignment to be filled out.

        Instead of directly trying to change your current schedule.
        Let's learn this tool by visualizing your current daily patterns.
        This then later also functions as a reference when you make adaptations.

        Think of ways you allow yourself to be distracted
        or what are good ways to take a break.
        We call this slacking off.
        When we need a break off of work,
        walking to get a glass of water or doing pushups is a good non addictive way to break work,
        scrolling social media isn't.

        Secondly, keep a list of topics you need to ponder over.
        Look at this list before activities that relax the mind,
        like running in nature.

        Last week we got the baseline and got into the habit of living with a calendar.
        This week we keep up the good work but start adding goals to it.

        Being correct in your planning is not the goal,
        being correct and consistent in applying the tools and living more by calendar is.

        sticking to your schedule is the most important.

        What you measure you will monitor.
        What you monitor you are aware of.
        Awareness is the first step.
        Tnen we acknowledge our short comings/inefficiencies.
        From which we can begin to improve.
        
        A colleague asked why I did not include my deep sleep in the graph.
        Basically I try to measure what I want to impact directly.
        Since I already know that not drinking alcohol and doing physical exercise helps,
        I just try to focus on that.
        For goals I'm working towards, like the bar-muscle-up I put a decimal value
        for all the day that I was working on it but still wasn't able to achieve it.

            Are you really on track?
            Did you create a system that works or that just works for you at this moment?
            Let's follow the Feynman technique by teaching it to someone else.
            By forcing yourself to explain it to someone else,
            you deeping your own understanding and confiction.
            Just like
            [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program#Sponsorship)
            systems use buddy/coaching systems as well.

            We also use this space to define activities which we allow ourself when in need of some slacking.
            These slacking activities should idealy be short and finite.

            
            Don't present yourself as someone who figured it out,
            but someone who is growing through actively trying to be the analyst steering their own life.

            You get to gift anyone a month for free by being their teacher (both have write access).
            Also serves as a commitment device, since you pretend to be a teacher, you need to sound convincing.

            During the lockdown in 2020 I went flying as digital nomad.
            This became harder in 2021 and some major border crossing were closed,
            but small bike / pedestrian crossings remained open.
            This enabled me to use these roads to travel with my motorcycles through
            various countries in the EU (as a digital nomad).
